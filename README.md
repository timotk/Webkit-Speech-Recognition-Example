# Webkit-Speech-Recognition-Example

Very simple speech recognition example that works with the Webkit browser engine, so only Webkit browsers such as Chrome.

```controller.js``` handles the button input and starts the recognition in ```speechRecognition.js```

# Usage
Run it on a server, for example with python:
```
$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

Access it with a Webkit browser like Google Chrome on `localhost:8000`.
